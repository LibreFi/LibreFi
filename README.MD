# LibreFi: Permissionless Margin Trading on Base

LibreFi is a cutting-edge noncustodial leveraged trading platform built on **Base**, Coinbase's Layer 2 scaling solution. Leveraging Base's low fees, fast transactions, and Ethereum security, LibreFi introduces an efficient and flexible trustless mechanism that revolutionizes margin trading. The protocol enables permissionless risk management, unrestricted market creation, and oracle-agnostic pricing. Users benefit from enhanced leverage options, optimized interest rates, and dramatically reduced gas fees thanks to Base's infrastructure. Built as a simple, immutable, and governance-minimized base layer, it serves as a robust foundation for the next generation of DeFi applications on Base.

### üöÄ Key Features

- **Permissionless listing of any coins (including meme coins)**: List and trade without approvals on Base's fast, low-cost network
- **Permissionless pool creation**: Create lending pools with your own parameters anytime, leveraging Base's efficient infrastructure
- **Margin trading with leverage**: Open and manage leveraged long/short positions with minimal gas costs
- **Base-optimized architecture**: Built specifically for Base's EVM compatibility and performance characteristics
- **Oracle-agnostic pricing**: Flexible price feed integration supporting multiple oracle providers
- **Reduced gas fees**: Leverage Base's Layer 2 scaling for cost-effective trading operations

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

LibreFi consists of multiple repositories, each handling a distinct part of the ecosystem:

### üìÅ Repository Structure
- **`/contracts/`** - Smart contracts and deployment scripts (this repository)
- **`/frontend/`** - Web interface and user experience

### üîß Smart Contract Documentation
For detailed technical documentation about the smart contracts, see the [contracts README](./contracts/README.md):

- **[How It Works](./contracts/HowItWorks.md)** - Core protocol mechanics
- **[LendingPool Factory](./contracts/LendingPoolFactory.md)** - Pool creation system
- **[LendingPool](./contracts/LendingPool.md)** - Individual lending pools
- **[PositionFactory](./contracts/PositionFactory.md)** - Position management
- **[Position](./contracts/Position.md)** - Individual trading positions

## üí° Why Base?
