# LibreFi: Permissionless Margin Trading

LibreFi is a noncustodial leveraged trading platform designed for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. It introduces an efficient and flexible trustless mechanism, improving upon existing margin trading solutions. The protocol enables permissionless risk management, unrestricted market creation, and oracle-agnostic pricing. Users benefit from enhanced leverage options, optimized interest rates, and reduced gas fees. Built as a simple, immutable, and governance-minimized base layer, it serves as a robust foundation for additional layers and integrations.
